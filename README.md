    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd VoiceCalendarAI-Full
   ```
2. Backend Setup

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Frontend Setup

     npm install
     ```

 ## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application Locally
 
 **Starting the Backend Server**
  - From the **backend** directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
  - The API will be available at **http://localhost:8000**. Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) will be automatically available at **http://localhost:8000/docs**.

**Starting the Frontend Development Server**
  - From the **frontend** directory:

 ``` bash
    npm run dev
 ```
  - The application will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.


## üîÆ Usage
1. **Grant Microphone Permissions:** Click "Start Recording" and allow the browser to access your microphone.

2. **Speak Your Event:** Clearly state your meeting or task. For example: "Lunch with Sarah at Cafe Neo this Friday at 1 PM for one hour."

3. **Stop Recording:** Click "Stop". The application will automatically process your audio.

4. **Review & Confirm:** The parsed event details (title, attendee, location, time) will appear. Confirm to add it to your calendar view.



## üß™ Testing the API
You can directly test the core **/process-audio** endpoint using **curl**:
```bash
    curl -X 'POST' \
      'http://localhost:8000/process-audio' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
      "audio": "your_base64_encoded_audio_string_here"
    }'
```
